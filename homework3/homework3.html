<h3>Milk Chocolate</h3>
<div><p class="description">Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK
    and
    Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union,
    the
    minimum is 25%.

<h3>White Chocolate</h3>
<div><p class="description">White chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not
    contain
    any cocoa solids
    that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white
    chocolate as
    the "common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive
    carbohydrate
    sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids".</p>

<h3>Dark Chocolate</h3>
<div><p class="description">Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and
    Drug
    Administration calls
    this "sweet chocolate", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of
    35% cocoa solids.</p>

        alt="Dark"></div>
<h3>Unsweetened Chocolate</h3>
<div><p class="description">Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It
    is
    unadulterated
    chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in
    baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw
    cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.
    Poorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom;
    it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely
    consumed</p><
