<h1>Chocolate</h1>
<p>Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste,
    on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods.</p>

    </ul>
    <p class="item-description">Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In
        the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the
        European Union, the minimum is 25%

    <ul>
        <li class="item">White</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="item-description">White chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does
        not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established
        a standard for white chocolate as the "common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa
        butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing
        no nonfat cocoa solids"</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="item">Dark</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="item-description">Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food
        and Drug Administration calls this "sweet chocolate", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor.
        European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids</p></div>

    <ul>
        <li class="item">Unsweetened</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="item-description">Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking
        chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep
        chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are
        added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.</p></div>
