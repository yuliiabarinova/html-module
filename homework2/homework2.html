<h2 class="heading">Biography</h2>
<p>Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands,
    including one named 'The Kids'. When he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) he took a job as a ballpoint-pen
    salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be
    a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated
    in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who
    falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the
        popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987).
    </li>
    <li>In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with
        director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward Scissorhands (1990)
    </li>
    <li>Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic
        performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike.
    </li>
    <li>Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey,
        Winona Ryder and Kate Moss.
